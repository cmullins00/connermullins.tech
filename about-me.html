									<h1>About Me</h1>
								</header>
								<div class="image fit"><img src="images/connermullins1.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Hello! I’m Conner Mullins, an aspiring software engineer with a passion for creating innovative solutions and helping others. I recently graduated from the University of Idaho, where I earned my degree in Computer Science. During my academic journey from 2019 to 2024, I was honored to be placed on the Dean’s List in Fall 2019, Fall 2021, Spring 2022, Fall 2022, and Spring 2024, reflecting my dedication and hard work.</p>

								<p>During my time at university, I developed a strong foundation in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), data structures and algorithms, and root-cause analysis. Most of my time was spent working in C, C++, and Python. I further improved my skills in front-end and back-end development through personal practice and my role as a fellow at HeadstarterAI. In this position, which began in late August and will continue until early September, I’ve worked on various projects involving AI models, building websites and applications that leverage these technologies to deliver valuable user experiences</p>
									
								<p>While I’m still exploring the full spectrum of opportunities that my degree can offer, I find great fulfillment in creating technology that enhance people's lives. My interests include applying machine learning to solve real-world problems and improve everyday experiences. I thrive on learning new things and stepping outside of my comfort zone, which fuels my enthusiasm for software engineering.</p>
									
								<p>Outside of my professional pursuits, I have a diverse set of hobbies that keep me inspired. I enjoy drawing, photography, and playing musical instruments. I’ve been playing the trombone for 12 years and have also been learning other instruments for fun. These creative outlets help me stay balanced and bring a unique perspective to my work.</p>
									
								<p>I’m always eager to connect with like-minded individuals and collaborate on exciting projects. Feel free to reach out to me via social media or email—I look forward to engaging with you and making a positive impact in our field.</p>
